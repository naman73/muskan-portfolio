export const summary =
  "I'm a strategic brand and marketing professional with 2+ years of hands-on experience at top advertising agencies, working across premium and mass-market brands. My strength lies in connecting consumer insights to brand positioning — understanding not just what a campaign needs to say, but why it matters to the audience and how it moves the business forward. From leading national TVC campaigns to shaping brand architecture for premium players like Hindware and Queo, I bring a strategic lens to every brief. I'm now looking to channel this thinking into a dedicated brand marketing or strategy role — where I can own the brand narrative, influence go-to-market decisions, and build brands with lasting equity.";

      "Brand Background: Hindware is one of India's leading premium bathroom solutions brands, competing in a market where aspiration-led buying and dealer trust drive purchase decisions.\n\nChallenge: Launch a TVC that positions Hindware as a brand synonymous with comfort and luxury — moving beyond product features to create an emotional connection with the premium homeowner TG.\n\nStrategy: Developed the 'Sukoon' (comfort) narrative — tapping into the insight that premium bathroom buyers seek a personal retreat, not just functional fixtures. Positioned Hindware as enabling that transformation.\n\nExecution: Led the campaign end-to-end — from consumer insight briefing to creative development, production coordination, and national media rollout across TV and digital.\n\nImpact: The campaign strengthened Hindware's premium salience, driving a measurable increase in brand recall among SEC A/A+ audiences during the campaign window.\n\nLearning: Premium brand communication succeeds when it sells a feeling, not a feature. Channel strategy must match the aspiration level of the TG — retail and digital play very different roles.",

      "Brand Background: KEI is a leading Indian electrical wire and cable manufacturer. While dominant in the trade segment, the brand needed to build consumer-facing salience to compete with lifestyle-positioned competitors.\n\nChallenge: Create a mass-market campaign that builds consumer trust and emotional resonance — moving KEI from a trade-focused brand to a household name.\n\nStrategy: Leveraged the RCB cricket partnership to tap into shared passion and trust. Built a 360° narrative connecting cricket's reliability and performance with KEI's promise of safety and quality.\n\nExecution: Managed deliverables across TV (national TVC), digital (YouTube pre-rolls, social media), print, and on-ground activations. Coordinated across creative, media, and production teams under tight IPL-season timelines.\n\nImpact: The campaign delivered significant uplift in unaided brand recall and drove consumer enquiries through dealer and digital channels.\n\nLearning: Sports marketing works best when the brand truth and the sports metaphor align authentically — forced associations erode trust. Speed and precision in campaign delivery are non-negotiable in sports-tied timelines.",

Identified health-conscious, value-driven homemakers as the primary TG.\n\nExecution: Developed go-to-market strategy including retail POS materials, digital launch assets, influencer seeding for health and cooking communities, and trade communication packs.\n\nImpact: Successful product launch across key North India markets, with initial sell-through exceeding internal targets within the first quarter.\n\nLearning: In FMCG product launches, the brand's existing equity is the most powerful differentiator — but it must be translated into the new category's language and consumer expectations.",

The India market required a unified brand identity system to bring consistency across a fragmented dealer network and diverse communication channels.\n\nChallenge: The brand's visual identity was inconsistent across dealer signage, digital assets, print ads, and trade communications — diluting brand recall and premium perception.\n\nStrategy: Developed a comprehensive brand guideline system anchored in Valvoline's global identity but adapted for India's dealer-driven distribution model. Focused on balancing premium visual codes with accessibility for trade partners.\n\nExecution: Led the redesign of the complete brand guideline document — covering logo usage, typography, color system, photography direction, and application templates for 15+ touchpoint types.\n\nImpact: Achieved brand visual consistency across digital and physical touchpoints within 6 months of rollout. Dealer compliance with brand guidelines improved significantly.\n\nLearning: Brand guidelines only work when they're designed for the people who use them — trade partners need simplicity and templates, not design theory.",

Ultra-premium buyers are design-led and experience-driven — they respond to exclusivity, craftsmanship, and architect influence.\n\nThis dual-brand experience sharpened my understanding of consumer segmentation, price-point psychology, and how channel strategy must shift between retail-led (Hindware) and specification-led (Queo) distribution models.\n\nDelivered 50+ SKU catalogues, export documentation, and campaign assets for both brands — maintaining distinct visual and verbal identities throughout.",
