export const summary =
  "I'm a brand and marketing professional with experience in brand executions and a growing interest in strategy. Over the last 2+ years, I've worked across premium and mass-market brands, helping bring campaigns to life across TV, digital, and social.\n\nI enjoy working through the details: shaping ideas, building stories, and making sure brand communication feels clear, consistent, and relevant wherever it shows up. While I have learnt operations well, I like understanding the thinking behind the work: the audience, the objective, and the role each piece plays in the bigger brand picture.\n\nHaving worked on brands like Valvoline, KEI Wires and Cables, Hindware and Queo, I'm now looking to move to a more challenging role, where I can continue learning, owning execution, and contributing more meaningfully to long-term brand building.";
